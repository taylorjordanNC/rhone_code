# 🪨🧻✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors - Bash Starter
# ==========================================
# Prompt to give the code assistant (use the Continue chat interface):
# 👉 Write a program in bash that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors. Ask the user to choose one,
#    have the computer randomly choose one, and print whether the user won, lost, or tied.

# 🎯 Objective:
# - Step 1: Ask the user to input rock, paper, or scissors
# - Step 2: Computer picks one randomly
# - Step 3: Compare choices and print win/lose/tie

# 🛠️ Continue.dev usage suggestions:
# - Use chat to ask: "How do I generate a random number in Bash?"
# - Use autocomplete to scaffold your case statements or comparison logic
# - Ask the assistant to make your script more readable or add features
# - Try “Explain” on the final block to understand what it’s doing

# 🤖 Model Tip:
# Start with a large model to get the full script scaffold.
# Then switch to a small one and ask it to "make it more fun" or "add a winning streak tracker."

# === 💡 Bonus Ideas ===
# Try these with Continue.dev after the game works:
# - Make it "best of 3" game
# - Add fun responses like "Scissors beats paper - snip!"
# - Add emojis or terminal color to the output
