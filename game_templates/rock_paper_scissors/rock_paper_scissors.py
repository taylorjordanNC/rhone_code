# 🪨🧻✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors - Python Starter
# ============================================
# Prompt to give the code assistant:
# 👉 Write a program in python that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors. Ask the user to choose one,
#    have the computer randomly choose one, and print whether the user won, lost, or tied.

# If you like the model output, hover over the response and select the middle icon to insert at cursor point. 
# Ensure the cursor is in the below section of the file where we'll keep our code.

# 🎯 Objective:
# - Step 1: Ask the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors
# - Step 2: Have the computer randomly pick one
# - Step 3: Compare and print the outcome (win, lose, tie)

# 🛠️ Try using these Continue.dev features:
# - Use autocomplete to finish each step one at a time
# - Use chat to ask: "How can I compare two choices in Python?"
# - Try the "Explain" function on your final code
# - Ask Continue to refactor or clean up your logic after you’re done

# 🤖 Model Tip:
# Try generating code with a large model, then switch to a smaller one (1B–2B)
# and ask it to add a playful twist. See how their outputs differ.

# === 💡 Bonus Ideas ===
# Try these with Continue.dev after the game works:
# - Make it "best of 3" game
# - Add fun responses like "Scissors beats paper - snip!"
# - Add emojis or terminal color to the output
