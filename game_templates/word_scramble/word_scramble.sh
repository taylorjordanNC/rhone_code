# 🧩 Word Scramble Game - Bash Starter
# ====================================
# Prompt to give the code assistant:
# 👉 Write a program in bash that scrambles a word and asks the user to guess the original.
#    Let them try again until they get it right or quit.

# 🎯 Objective:
# - Step 1: Define a word and scramble the letters
# - Step 2: Show the scrambled word to the user
# - Step 3: Repeat until the user guesses right or types 'quit'
# - Step 4: Print a success message

# 🛠️ Continue.dev usage tips:
# - Use autocomplete to scaffold the loop and input logic
# - Ask: "How can I shuffle characters in a string in Bash?"
# - Use chat to refactor, make it more fun, or add difficulty levels
# - Try “Explain” if you're not sure what a particular block does

# 🤖 Model Tip:
# Use a larger model to handle the shuffle logic,
# then switch to a small one and ask: “Add encouragement messages” or “Add color to correct guesses.”
