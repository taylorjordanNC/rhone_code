# 🧩 Word Scramble Game - Python Starter
# ======================================
# Prompt to give the code assistant:
# 👉 Write a program in python that scrambles a word and asks the user to guess the original.
#    Let them try again until they get it right or quit.

# 🎯 Objective:
# - Step 1: Choose or define a word to scramble
# - Step 2: Scramble the word and display it to the user
# - Step 3: Loop until the user guesses correctly or chooses to quit
# - Step 4: Print success message when correct

# 🛠️ Try using these Continue.dev features:
# - Autocomplete a function to shuffle a word
# - Ask chat: “How do I scramble letters in a string?”
# - Try “Explain” on the loop or randomization logic
# - Use the assistant to make the prompts more fun or dynamic

# 🤖 Model Tip:
# Start with a large model to scaffold the game logic.
# Then switch to a 1–2B model and ask: “Make this game sillier” or “Add multiple difficulty levels.”

# Step 1: Choose a word and scramble it


# Step 2: Prompt user to guess repeatedly


# Step 3: Track win or quit condition and print result


# === 💡 Bonus Ideas ===
# Try these with Continue.dev after the game works:
# - Make it a “best of 3” game
# - Add playful responses (e.g., “You’re getting warmer... 🔥”)
# - Add emojis or terminal colors to celebrate a win 🎉
