# 🧠 Simple Quiz Game - Bash Starter
# ==================================
# Prompt to give the code assistant:
# 👉 Write a program in bash that asks 3 trivia questions and gives the user a score at the end.
#    Accept user input for each answer and print whether it’s correct.

# 🎯 Objective:
# - Step 1: Ask 3 trivia questions

# 🛠️ Continue.dev usage tips:
# - Use autocomplete for input prompts and comparison logic
# - Use chat: "Make the quiz accept uppercase or lowercase answers"
# - Try “Explain” on a section you don’t understand
# - Ask it to “Add colors to correct and incorrect answers” for fun output

# 🤖 Model Tip:
# Use a larger model to build the base logic, then try a small one and ask:
# "Can you add trivia hints after each question?" or "Make it more visual in the terminal."
