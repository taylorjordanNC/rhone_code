# 🧠 Simple Quiz Game - Python Starter
# ====================================
# Prompt to give the code assistant:
# 👉 Write a program in Python that asks 3 trivia questions and gives the user a score at the end.
#    Accept user input for each answer and print whether it’s correct.

# If you like the model output, hover over the response and select the middle icon to insert at cursor point. 
# Ensure the cursor is in the below section of the file where we'll keep our code.

# 🎯 Objective:
# - Step 1: Ask 3 trivia questions
# - Step 2: Accept user input and check if the answer is correct
# - Step 3: Print feedback after each question and show a final score

# 🛠️ Try using these Continue.dev features:
# - Use autocomplete to generate the quiz logic or individual questions
# - Use chat to say: "Can you make my quiz multiple choice?"
# - Try “Explain” to understand how the answer-checking logic works
# - Ask: “Refactor this to make it cleaner” or “Add color to correct/incorrect answers”

# 🤖 Model Tip:
# Use a large model to scaffold the full quiz.
# Then switch to a smaller one and ask: “Make the output more fun” or “Add random trivia facts.”

# === 💡 Bonus Ideas ===
# Try these with Continue.dev after the game works:
# - Ask the AI to add more questions
# - Make it multiple choice
# - Track correct/incorrect answers and print a summary at the end
